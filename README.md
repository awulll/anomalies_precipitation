Precipitation anomalies in Brazil

The idea here is use ANA database for collect precipitation series 
The code ana.py contains functions that create a local station inventory and download station data series for a specific area.
At this moment the area is provided by a shapefile using EPSG 4326 (WGS84).
Modules used includes Urllib, Beautiful Soup and Pyshp - all can be easily downloaded with pip.
